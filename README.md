Reading may take a long time. Several studies have proved this is due to two factors. 

1) Subvocalizing: When you manually sound out and say every word in your head rather than speed reading. It has no proven comprehension benefits and wastes time.
2) Keeping Track: It is hard to keep track of every single word as you move your eyes without a pointer like your finger showing you the next word.

This fixes the first issue by forcing you to go at a fast pace so you don't have enough time to subvocalize as you can choose your own reading speed. 
It fixes the second issue by constantly giving you a reminder of the word you are on by bolding it just like your finger would as a pointer. 
Notice: This only works for text you can copy and paste into the website. 

The average reeding speed is 300 WPM or a word every 200 MS. See if you can beat that time by setting the next word to be bolded at a time of your amount.

Notice: If you are ever reading slower than you normally read without this tool, decrease how long each word will be bolded for.
